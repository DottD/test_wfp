# Requirements

All the tests have been run with Python 3.11 and the requirements can be installed by running `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Execution

The `standalone-code.py` file contains the whole code that does everything requested by question 1-4.

```bash
python standalone-code.py
```

It will produce the file `output.xlsx` just next to it, with all the required information.
